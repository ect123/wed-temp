<h2>What to expect</h2>
<p>This is an opportunity for our friends and family to get together to celebrate our marraige with us! We aren't planning a traditional ceremony, but hope to instead have this be a chance for people to come together and have a good time in our hometown. You can expect lots of eating, drinking, and "winging it". Evan will probably wear shorts, Marybeth will probably wear Birkenstocks, and you should feel comfortable wearing whatever you want too.</p>

<h4>Location</h4>
<p>TBD â€“ but will be somewhere in Vancouver, British Columbia.</p>
<h4>Date</h4>
<p>July 7, 2020.</p><p> <img src="img/711.png" alt="7-11" width="50px" align="left"></p>

<h4>Gifts</h4>
<p><strong>Please consider coming to Vancouver as your gift to us. Gifts are totally optional!</strong>
<p>If you would like to contribute to our savings fund for a down payment on a home in honor of our marriage, then it's greatly appreciated! These will go into our fund, and we'll let you know when they're used.</p>
