<h1>Traveling to Vancouver</h1>
<p>If you need to get in touch with us for whatever reason, feel free to email anytime: <a target="_blank" href="https://mailhide.io/e/iqIxq"><strong>Evan</strong></a>  or <a target="_blank" href="https://mailhide.io/e/M7kT6"><strong>Marybeth</strong></a></p> <p <span class="blinking">We are REALLY looking forward to having everyone together in Vancouver!</span></p>
<h2>Accomodations</h2>
<p>If you're coming from out of town, we invite you to spend as much time as you want to in Vancouver. We don't have specific plans for the week before our celebration, but if you're around, we'll make some!</p>
<h4>Hotels</h4>
<p>We've arranged to have 10 rooms set aside at the <a href="https://www.radissonhotels.com/en-us/hotels/park-inn-vancouver-bc?cid=a:se+b:gmb+c:amer+i:local+e:pii+d:ca+h:BCVANCOU" target="_blank">Park Inn & Suites by Radisson Vancouver</a>. These rooms are available for Friday and Saturday at discounted rates:</p>
  <p>$259 CAD (~$197 USD) + 16% tax / night for a standard room (2 double beds)<br>
  $269 CAD (~$204 USD) + 16% tax / night for a view room (2 double beds)</p>
<p>These prices are for 1-2 people and don't include a breakfast ($23.50 CAD per person) or parking ($15 CAD per day). This was least expensive option available for a group in a 3-star or higher hotel in Vancouver. It is in a really good location close to the SkyTrain, busses, Granville Island, restaurants, etc., albeit on a busy street.</p>
<p>If you'd like to reserve one of the rooms for your stay, you can either contact the hotel by phone at 604-872-8661; or by email at reservations@parkinn-vancouver.ca. Make sure to use the Group Name "<strong>Wedding Block - Thornberry</strong>". The rates expire on May 22, 2020.
</p>
<p>If you aren't staying at the Park Inn and Suites – Vancouver's main hotel cluster is located in the downtown core, which is convenient for sight-seeing and taking advantage of public transportation. Steamworks Brewery is also located very close to downtown in historic Gas Town. However, prices are generally above average. If you prefer a hotel stay take a look at these options for <a href="https://www.google.com/travel/hotels/Vancouver?g2lb=2502405%2C2502548%2C4208993%2C4254308%2C4258168%2C4260007%2C4270442%2C4274032%2C4285990%2C4291318%2C4301054%2C4305595%2C4308216%2C4313006%2C4314846%2C4315873%2C4317915%2C4324293%2C4326405%2C4328159%2C4329288%2C4270859%2C4284970%2C4291517%2C4292955%2C4316256%2C4333108&hl=en&gl=ca&un=1&q=best%20hotels%20in%20vancouver&rp=EJD18dXLl_ahZhDBgdrUgOy-yTMQnovvjZyZ9I1REN7G_bLkuPbxDjgBQABIAg&ictx=1&ved=2ahUKEwiNspK-8PHmAhXSPn0KHWJfDGkQtDV6BAgLEAU&hrf=CgUIrAIQACIDQ0FEKhYKBwjkDxAHGAoSBwjkDxAHGAwYAiABSAiwAQBYAWgBmgELEglWYW5jb3V2ZXKiARUKCC9tLzA4MGgyEglWYW5jb3V2ZXKqAQoKAgghEgIICBgBqgEKCgIIEhICCGgYAaoBBwoDCKECGACqAQ4KAggcEgIIcxICCDYYAaoBCgoCCCUSAgh6GAGqAQ4KAggREgIIQBICCDgYAaoBKAoCCC4SAgg7EgMImQESAwiHARICCBoSAgg9EgIISxICCAwSAggnGAGqAQ8KAghQEgMIhAESAghMGAGqAQ4KAgg1EgIIExICCDIYAZIBAiAB&tcfs=Ei8KCC9tLzA4MGgyEglWYW5jb3V2ZXIaGAoKMjAyMC0wNy0xMBIKMjAyMC0wNy0xMiIYCgoyMDIwLTA3LTEwEgoyMDIwLTA3LTEyUgVVAACAQA" target="_blank"><strong>2 nights (Friday to Sunday), for two people</strong></a>. We definitely recommend reading public reviews of any hotel you're considering, especially anything in the budget range.</p>
<h4>AirBnb</h4>
<p>AirBnb is a great option for stays in Vancouver as they can be located in parts of town with a more local atmosphere than downtown. There seem to be a wider range of prices as well. If you choose to stay in an AirBnb and would like to be near us or a specific location, let us know and we can help you decide on a spot! Check out these <a href="https://www.airbnb.ca/s/Vancouver--BC/homes?refinement_paths%5B%5D=%2Fhomes&current_tab_id=home_tab&selected_tab_id=home_tab&source=mc_search_bar&search_type=unknown&screen_size=large&hide_dates_and_guests_filters=false&ne_lat=49.29382792513632&ne_lng=-123.05774879882813&sw_lat=49.18309311979061&sw_lng=-123.22803688476563&zoom=12&search_by_map=true&checkin=2020-07-10&checkout=2020-07-12&adults=2" target="_blank">options for 2 people / 2 nights</a>.
<p>If you'd like to consider where we live when choosing a place to stay, we are in the Kitsilano neighborhood (marked on the map).<p>

<h2>Travel</h2>

<h4>US / Canada Border</h4>
<p>If you're coming from the US, the main thing to make sure of is that you have a valid passport. If you don't, you won't get into Canada. If you have specific concerns about crossing into Canada, take a look at this information about <a href="https://www.cic.gc.ca/english/helpcentre/answer.asp?qnum=1116&top=16" target="_blank">the basic requirements</a> for crossing the border as a US citizen.</p>

<h4>Flying to Vancouver</h4>
<p>Vancouver International Airport (YVR) is probably the most convenient option for anyone flying in. There are taxis at the airport for you to get to your accomodations, as well as a lightrail (<a href="https://www.translink.ca/Schedules-and-Maps/SkyTrain.aspx" target="_blank">SkyTrain</a>) to Downtown.</p>

<h4>Getting Around</h4>
<p><strong>Vancouver just got Uber or Lyft services in January 2020!</strong> So for those of you who are used to using either one, you're in luck. But we also have a great public transportation system including busses, light-rail, and our beloved <a href="https://www.translink.ca/Schedules-and-Maps/SeaBus-Schedules.aspx" target="_blank">SeaBus</a>. There are also a couple of water taxi companies to take you around False Creek / Granville Island, including the <a href="https://theaquabus.com/" target="_blank">Aquabus</a> and <a href="http://granvilleislandferries.bc.ca/" target="_blank">False Creek Ferries</a>.</p> <p>Our plans don't include anything that will require you to leave the city. However, if you want to spend some time getting to know Vancouver or the surrounding area on your own terms and routes, renting a car at the airport is a great choice too. Aside from the traffic on major roads and <em>especially</em> bridges, city driving in Vancouver is relatively pleseant.</p>

<h2>Other Stuff to be aware of</h2>
<h4>Weather</h4>
<p>Summertime weather in the Vancouver area is nearly ideal, but it can be cool near the water and at night. It's unlikely that we'll get lots of rain in July, as almost all of our rain comes during the winter months.</p>
