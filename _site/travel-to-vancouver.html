<h1>Travelling to Vancouver</h1>
<p>If you need to get in touch with us for whatever reason, feel free to email anytime: <strong>evanthornberry at gmail.com or miller.mbeth at gmail.com</strong></p> <p <span class="blinking">We are REALLY looking forward to having everyone together in Vancouver!</span></p>
<h2>Accomodations</h2>
<p>If you're coming from out of town, we invite you to spend as much time as you want to in Vancouver. We don't have specific plans for the week before our celebration, but if you're around, we'll make some!</p>
<h4>Hotels</h4>
<p>Vancouver's main hotel cluster is located in the downtown core, which is convenient for sight-seeing and taking advantage of public transportation. However, prices are generally above average. If you prefer a hotel stay take a look at these options for <a href="https://www.google.com/travel/hotels/Vancouver?g2lb=2502405%2C2502548%2C4208993%2C4254308%2C4258168%2C4260007%2C4270442%2C4274032%2C4285990%2C4291318%2C4301054%2C4305595%2C4308216%2C4313006%2C4314846%2C4315873%2C4317915%2C4324293%2C4326405%2C4328159%2C4329288%2C4270859%2C4284970%2C4291517%2C4292955%2C4316256%2C4333108&hl=en&gl=ca&un=1&q=best%20hotels%20in%20vancouver&rp=EJD18dXLl_ahZhDBgdrUgOy-yTMQnovvjZyZ9I1REN7G_bLkuPbxDjgBQABIAg&ictx=1&ved=2ahUKEwiNspK-8PHmAhXSPn0KHWJfDGkQtDV6BAgLEAU&hrf=CgUIrAIQACIDQ0FEKhYKBwjkDxAHGAoSBwjkDxAHGAwYAiABSAiwAQBYAWgBmgELEglWYW5jb3V2ZXKiARUKCC9tLzA4MGgyEglWYW5jb3V2ZXKqAQoKAgghEgIICBgBqgEKCgIIEhICCGgYAaoBBwoDCKECGACqAQ4KAggcEgIIcxICCDYYAaoBCgoCCCUSAgh6GAGqAQ4KAggREgIIQBICCDgYAaoBKAoCCC4SAgg7EgMImQESAwiHARICCBoSAgg9EgIISxICCAwSAggnGAGqAQ8KAghQEgMIhAESAghMGAGqAQ4KAgg1EgIIExICCDIYAZIBAiAB&tcfs=Ei8KCC9tLzA4MGgyEglWYW5jb3V2ZXIaGAoKMjAyMC0wNy0xMBIKMjAyMC0wNy0xMiIYCgoyMDIwLTA3LTEwEgoyMDIwLTA3LTEyUgVVAACAQA" target="_blank"><strong>2 nights (Friday to Sunday), for two people</strong></a>.  We definitely recommend reading public reviews of any hotel you're considering, especially anything in the budget range.</p>
<h4>AirBnb</h4>
<p>AirBnb is a great option for stays in Vancouver as they can be located in parts of town with a more local atmosphere than downtown. There seem to be a wider range of prices as well. If you choose to stay in an AirBnb and would like to be near us or a specific location, let us know and we can help you decide on a spot! Check out these <a href="https://www.airbnb.ca/s/Vancouver--BC/homes?refinement_paths%5B%5D=%2Fhomes&current_tab_id=home_tab&selected_tab_id=home_tab&source=mc_search_bar&search_type=unknown&screen_size=large&hide_dates_and_guests_filters=false&ne_lat=49.29382792513632&ne_lng=-123.05774879882813&sw_lat=49.18309311979061&sw_lng=-123.22803688476563&zoom=12&search_by_map=true&checkin=2020-07-10&checkout=2020-07-12&adults=2" target="_blank">options for 2 people / 2 nights</a>.

<h2>Travel</h2>

<h4>US / Canada Border</h4>
<p>If you're coming from the US, the main thing to make sure of is that you have a valid passport. If you don't, you won't get into Canada. If you have specific concerns about crossing into Canada, take a look at this information about <a href="https://www.cic.gc.ca/english/helpcentre/answer.asp?qnum=1116&top=16" target="_blank">the basic requirements</a> for crossing the border as a US citizen.</p>

<h4>Flying to Vancouver</h4>
<p>Vancouver International Airport (YVR) is probably the most convenient option for anyone flying in. There are taxis at the airport for you to get to your accomodations, as well as a lightrail (<a href="https://www.translink.ca/Schedules-and-Maps/SkyTrain.aspx" target="_blank">SkyTrain</a>) to Downtown.</p>

<h4>Getting Around</h4>
<p>Vancouver doesn't yet have Uber or Lyft (maybe by this summer!), but we have a great public transportation system including busses, light-rail, and our beloved <a href="https://www.translink.ca/Schedules-and-Maps/SeaBus-Schedules.aspx" target="_blank">SeaBus</a>. There are also a couple of water taxi companies to take you around False Creek / Granville Island, including the <a href="https://theaquabus.com/" target="_blank">Aquabus</a> and <a href="http://granvilleislandferries.bc.ca/" target="_blank">False Creek Ferries</a>.</p> <p>Our plans don't include anything that will require you to leave the city. However, if you want to spend some time getting to know Vancouver or the surrounding area on your own terms and routes, renting a car at the airport is a great choice too. Aside from the traffic on major roads and <em>especially</em> bridges, city driving in Vancouver is relatively pleseant.</p>

<h2>Other Stuff to be aware of</h2>
<h4>Weather</h4>
<p>Summertime weather in the Vancouver area is nearly ideal, but it can be cool near the water and at night. It's unlikely that we'll get lots of rain in July, as almost all of our rain comes during the winter months.</p>
